To run the app:
cd into both the client and server folders and run "yarn install"

Run "node app.js" in the server folder to start the server running locally, using a stripe test API key this will then pull product data through.

Then run "yarn start" in the client directory which should initialise the client, collecting this data from the server API.

Other useful commands:
"yarn test" - runs unit tests
